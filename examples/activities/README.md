# Activities for the enviroplus and enviro boards
#### Note: All of these activities call the nicenames modification to the original library

When using the enviroplus you have a gas sensor and optional particulate matter sensor.
The enviro doesn't have these parts.

All of the enviro activities will work with both boards.
The enviro*plus* activities will only work with the enviro*plus*.

If you are after more understanding of the board, and less about a getting-familiar-quick, do not use these activities, and instead stick with the examples in the standard library.

Each example has an accompanying markdown text with suggestions for modifying the example to explore the functions of the board.

If you work your way through the examples you should be familiar with what the board can do, and be able to take readings and use them in simple ways.
