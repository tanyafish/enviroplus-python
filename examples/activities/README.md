# Activities for the enviroplus and enviro boards
#### All of these activities call the nicenames modification to the original library

A selection of activities to use with the enviro and the enviroplus.

When using the enviroplus you have a gas sensor and optional particulate matter sensor.
The enviro doesn't have these parts.

All of the enviro activities will work with both boards.
The enviro*plus* activities will only work with the enviro*plus*.

If you are after more understanding of the board, and less about a getting-familiar-quick, do not use these activities, and instead stick with the examples in the standard library.
